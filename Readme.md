# Throne Of Valor

## Choose a tournament size - and let the battle for valor begin


Throne of Valor throws you into a chaotic medieval tournament where no two battles are the same. Fight across arenas that range from a deadly lava pit to spike-lined deathtraps to The Colosseum, and arm yourself with weapons that drop randomly â€” from swords to guns. Play in local multiplayer tournaments of 2, 4, 8, or even 16 warriors, battling through 1v1 duels until a single champion claims the throne. Every round forces you to adapt, making each fight unpredictable, intense, and packed with medieval mayhem. Will you master the chaos and seize the crown? ðŸ‘‘
