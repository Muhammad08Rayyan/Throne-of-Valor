# Throne of Valor - Complete Game Documentation

## üìù Game Descriptions

### Short Description
**2-player medieval fighter where sacrifices unlock devastating powers - risk your life to claim the throne!**

### Long Description
**Throne of Valor** is an intense 2-player local multiplayer medieval-fantasy fighting game where the theme of sacrifice runs deep. Compete in elimination tournaments (2-16 players) across deadly arenas with hazards that kill instantly. Choose between the Path of Fury (high damage, low health) or Path of Endurance (high health, low damage) before each battle, each with unique passive abilities that activate when you're near death.

The sacrifice mechanic is central to gameplay: use the Sacrifice Attack to deal double damage but lose 30 HP if you miss, activate Blood Gambit to spend 30% of your max HP for a random powerful buff, and survive the Overtime Sacrifice where both fighters drain 5 HP per second until one falls. If both die simultaneously, enter Sudden Death mode where both warriors have 1 HP and the first strike wins. Every decision carries weight - will you risk everything for victory?
